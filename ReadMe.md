## Features 🌟

- **Redesigned Hero Section**: A dynamic hero section with a grid of images that scale and elevate on hover, paired with bold, animated text that shifts in 3D space for a striking visual effect. 📸
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions and JavaScript-driven hover effects bring the hero section to life, with images scaling up and text moving backward in a 3D perspective. 🎬
- **Great UI Design**: Clean, modern typography and a dark theme create a sleek, professional look, with a focus on visual hierarchy and user engagement. 🎨
- **Fully Responsive**: The navbar adapts seamlessly across devices, transforming into a hamburger menu on mobile with a full-screen navigation overlay, including language toggle (FR/EN). 📱
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover interactions in the hero section enhance user engagement, with images gaining prominence and text fading to emphasize visuals. 🖱️
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Tested for consistent performance across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). 🌐
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Optimized code and assets for quick loading times, balancing aesthetics and performance. ⚡

## Tech Stack 💻

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for structure and accessibility. 🏗️
- **CSS3**: Styling with flexbox, media queries, and 3D transforms for animations. 🎨
- **JavaScript**: Event handling for interactivity and navbar toggle functionality. ⚙️
- **Git**: Version control for tracking changes and collaboration. 📂
